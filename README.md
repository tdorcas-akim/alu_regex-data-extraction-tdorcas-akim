This is a python script that helps extracting common types of data from text. It functions using regex to look for patterns in your content.
It takes out information by using: - email address(example@domain.com).
                                   - URLs (https://website.com)
                                   - time formats like 9:55 AM and 5:55 PM
                                   - Currency values ($10.99, 25000 BIF)
                                   - Hashtags (#Example)
Step 1: Choose a sample text and run the script, allow it to analyze the text. 
Step 2: Input your text by entering it (record your response by pressing Enter twice at the end).
